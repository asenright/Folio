<h1>Pipelined Processor Design</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
The Verilog code given here must be run on a Verilog-compatible simulator, such as Synopsis.

<h2>What's In It</h2>
The processor is broken into modules; each has its own testbench. For example, to test programcounter.v, you would compile and run programcounter_fixture.v
For more info about the instruction set, see the documentation .pdf.

<h2>Versioning</h2>
We use SemVer for versioning. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository.
