Project Title
Pipelined Processor Design

Prerequisites
The Verilog code given here must be run on a Verilog-compatible simulator, such as Synopsis.

What's In It
The processor is broken into modules; each has its own testbench. For example, to test programcounter.v, you would compile and run programcounter_fixture.v
For more info about the instruction set, see the documentation .pdf.

Versioning
