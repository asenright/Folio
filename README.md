# Folio

This repository is intended to showcase code I found challenging or interesting to write- a portfolio of my work.

I will continue to expand it and refine it as I work; by no means is this a complete showcase of my skills.

If you're a student and are looking for answers, I hope you find them here.
If you're a professional programmer and Google has led you here, feel free to use whatever you find. It's all under MIT license.
